# RTSP (Real time Streaming Protocol)
This App is streaming app for android operating system. 
we just have to pass streaming protocol. 
Streaming Protocol url should be in given format:

Format------>   rtsp://ip:port/appname/streamname
Example----->   rtsp://f53cf08c0fc6.entrypoint.cloud.wowza.com:1935/app-47hc3626/10d9a3e9

This assumes that "f53cf08c0fc6.entrypoint.cloud.wowza.com" 
is the IP address or hostname of the server, "1935" is the port number,
"app-47hc3626" is the name of the application, and "10d9a3e9" is the name of the stream.
